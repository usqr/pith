"""
Shared path-safety helpers for Pith tools.

The `ingest` and `compile` workflows ask an LLM to propose wiki page paths.
The LLM's input is untrusted (external documents, fetched URLs), so its
output — and therefore the proposed paths — must be treated as untrusted too.

Without validation, `Path(cwd) / proposed` accepts absolute paths verbatim
(`Path('/a') / '/b' == Path('/b')`) and `..` traversal, which would let a
poisoned source overwrite arbitrary files — including the hook scripts
themselves at ~/.claude/hooks/pith/, turning a write into persistent RCE.

`safe_wiki_path` resolves the candidate under `<cwd>/wiki/`, refuses symlinks
whose targets escape, and raises on anything outside. Callers should catch
`ValueError` and skip the offending page without aborting the whole run.
