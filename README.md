# Pith

**Token optimization for Claude Code. Automatic where it matters most.**

40–70% token reduction out of the box. Auto-escalation. Hindsight pruning. Symbol extraction. Project wiki. Interactive knowledge graph. Install once — every project, forever.

---

## Install

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhisekjha/pith/main/install.sh)
```

Or from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhisekjha/pith
bash pith/install.sh
```

Or from inside Claude Code:
```
/pith install
```

One command. Hooks install globally into `~/.claude/hooks/`. Every Claude Code session, every project, from that point on.

## What it does

### Always on — zero config required

**Tool output compression** — the biggest token sink nobody touches.

When Claude reads a 400-line TypeScript file, it receives the skeleton (imports, signatures, types) — not 400 lines. When bash returns 200 lines of npm output, Claude gets errors and a summary. Grep results are capped at 25 matches. Large outputs over 300 tokens are offloaded to `~/.pith/tmp/` and replaced with a 3-line pointer.

```
Before: Read large-service.ts → 1,800 tokens
After:  Read large-service.ts →   210 tokens   (−88%)

Before: npm install output   →   940 tokens
After:  errors + 3-line summary →  80 tokens   (−91%)
```

**Auto-escalation (SWEzze · arXiv:2603.28119)**

As your context fills, Pith ratchets compression automatically — no manual intervention needed.

```
50% fill → LEAN mode activated  (response length cut ~25%)
70% fill → ULTRA mode activated (response length cut ~42%)
85% fill → dynamic ceiling = 8% of remaining headroom
```

Mode ratchets up, never down. Prevents responses from eating the remaining context window unchecked. Toggle with `/pith escalate on|off`.

**Hindsight pruning**

Once per session when context passes 60%, Pith scans tool call telemetry and identifies waste: files read multiple times (only the latest matters), large early-session outputs that are now irrelevant. Reports stale token cost and recommends `/compact` with an exact savings estimate.

```
[PITH HINDSIGHT: 3 stale reads · 4,200 tokens recoverable
  auth.ts read 3× (keep latest: turn 29) · 1,840 tok
  npm install output (turn 2, irrelevant) · 1,120 tok
  → Run /compact to recover ~4.2k tokens]
```

**Cache-Lock (Phase 9)**

Session-start rules are hashed. If your settings haven't changed since last session, a single 1-line summary is emitted instead of the full rules block — saving ~300 tokens every session start. Protects your prompt cache.

**Token meter in statusline**
```
PITH 12k/200k
PITH:LEAN 45k/200k
PITH:WIKI 89k/200k 🟡
```

**Auto-compact at 70% context**

Conversation history is summarized automatically at 70% fill. Sessions run indefinitely.

### On demand — type a command

**Output compression modes**
```
/pith              → lean (drop articles, short synonyms, fragments OK)
/pith precise      → professional and tight (no filler, full sentences)
/pith ultra        → maximum (abbreviate, arrows →, tables over prose)
/pith off          → standard Claude output, no compression
/pith escalate on  → enable auto-escalation (default)
/pith escalate off → disable auto-escalation
```

**Symbol extraction (~95% token reduction)**
```
/pith symbol src/auth.ts handleLogin    → exact 30–50 lines of definition
/pith symbol --list src/auth.ts         → all symbols with line numbers
```

Uses tree-sitter AST when available, regex fallback otherwise. Supports Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Go, Java, Kotlin, Rust, C#, and more.

**Speculative Fetch** — When extracting a symbol, Pith automatically scans the body for calls to other functions in the same file and appends their signatures. Eliminates ~60% of follow-up symbol lookups.

**Session analytics**
```
/pith status    → ASCII token flow chart (baseline → removed → in-context → output)
/pith report    → interactive HTML dashboard in ~/.pith/report.html (opens browser)
/pith hindsight → manual hindsight analysis, anytime
```

![/pith status — token flow chart, compression ratio, cost breakdown](assets/status-screenshot.png)

**Structured formats** — each answer fits a template, no prose waste
```
/pith debug     problem / cause / fix / verify
/pith review    L42: BUG token expiry wrong unit. Fix: token.exp * 1000
/pith arch      options table + decision + risks
/pith plan      numbered steps + risks + done-when
/pith commit    feat(auth): add token refresh on 401
```

**Token budget**
```
/pith budget 100     → ≤100 tokens per response, hard ceiling
/pith budget off     → remove ceiling
```

**Focus**
```
/pith focus src/services/auth.ts    → load only sections relevant to current question
```

**Wiki**
```
/pith wiki "why did we choose Redis?"   → search the project wiki
/pith ingest raw/sources/article.md    → add source, update wiki pages (jCodeMunch for code)
/pith ingest --url https://...         → fetch URL, save to raw/sources/, ingest
/pith compile                          → batch re-synthesis from all sources
/pith compile --topic "auth"           → recompile pages for one topic only
/pith compile --dry-run                → show compile plan, write nothing
/pith wiki                             → toggle wiki mode on/off
/pith lint                             → semantic checks: contradictions, gaps, missing pages
/pith lint --fix                       → same + auto-create stubs for missing entities
/pith lint --quick                     → structural checks only, no LLM
```

## The project wiki

Pith builds and maintains a persistent knowledge base for your project. You direct. The LLM writes and maintains everything.

```
my-project/
  wiki/
    index.md          ← catalog of all pages
    log.md            ← session history
    overview.md       ← project summary
    entities/         ← tools, services, components (one page each)
    concepts/         ← patterns, methods, ideas
    decisions/        ← architecture decision records
  raw/sources/        ← drop documents here, /pith ingest them
```

**jCodeMunch** — When you ingest a code file, Pith runs `symbols.py --list` first to extract the structural skeleton (imports, signatures, class outlines), then passes that to a code-aware analysis prompt. Creates Module and Class wiki pages with exports, key methods, and architectural dependencies.

**Greenfield:** three questions on first run, wiki grows as you build.  
**Brownfield:** optional bootstrap — one session to read the codebase and write initial pages.  
**Ongoing:** after every decision or solution, one-line offer to save it.

## Honest numbers

Token savings come from ten independent layers.

| Layer | Mechanism | Realistic reduction |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Tool compression | PostToolUse hook — file skeleton, bash summary, grep cap | 30–50% of context |
| Tool offloading | Results >300 tok → `~/.pith/tmp/`, pointer in context | Prevents large payload bloat |
| Symbol extraction | Exact function/class lines via tree-sitter or regex | ~95% vs full file read |
| Auto-escalation | LEAN at 50%, ULTRA at 70%, ceiling at 85% | 25–42% of output tokens |
| Cache optimization | Restructure CLAUDE.md stable prefix | 10–20% of cost |
| Cache-Lock | Hash session-start rules — skip re-injection if unchanged | ~300 tok/session start |
| Auto-compact | Summarize history at 70% threshold | Unlimited sessions |
| Output formats | Structured templates vs prose | 20–35% of output |
| Token budget | Hard ceiling per response | User-controlled |
| Input focus | Load only relevant file sections | 5–20× on large docs |

**What these numbers mean:** in a typical 30-turn coding session, tool compression + auto-compact alone cuts total token spend by 40–55%. Add output compression and auto-escalation and you reach 55–70%.

These are honest estimates. Not measured against "no system prompt." Against real usage.

## Session report

Run `/pith report` at any time to generate `~/.pith/report.html` — a standalone interactive dashboard showing:

- KPI cards: compression ratio, tokens saved, cost ROI, context fill
- Token flow bars: baseline → Pith intercepted → sent to context → model output
- Savings donut: breakdown by category (skeletons, bash, grep, TOON, web, offload, output mode)
- Cost table: actual spend vs what the session would have cost without Pith
- Compression event timeline from telemetry

---

## Uninstall

```bash
bash pith/uninstall.sh
```

Or from inside Claude:
```
/pith uninstall
```

Removes hooks and statusline from `~/.claude/settings.json`. Token history preserved at `~/.pith/`.

---

## Evals

Pith measures itself honestly.

```bash
# Generate snapshot (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
uv run python evals/harness.py

# Analyze snapshot (reads committed results.json)
python3 evals/measure.py
```

Three arms: baseline / terse / pith. Honest delta is **pith vs terse** — how much the skill adds on top of "Answer concisely." Token counts from Claude API `usage` field. Quality scored by Claude-as-judge on completeness, accuracy, and actionability.

```bash
# Real API benchmarks across compression modes
uv run python benchmarks/run.py [--dry-run]
```
